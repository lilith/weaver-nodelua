# Weaver engine framework

2014 Weaver engine prototype - using Node, NodeLua, Lua, and Pluto. 

This branch of the weaver engine framework is based on Node and Lua. The app framework ecosystem around Node.js is a bit richer than Lua's, so we can take advantage of that to let Lua focus on the game scripts themselves.
